# Math Assessment Solutions

This repository contains the solution for a math assessment generation assignment.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this assignment was to create two new math questions, similar in style and difficulty to two given base questions. The new questions needed to be formatted using a specific structure and include all required fields such as subject, unit, topic, and explanation.

## Generated Questions
The file `new_questions.docx` contains the two newly generated questions.
-   **Question 1:** A new combinatorics problem about calculating different sundae combinations.
-   **Question 2:** A new geometry problem about finding the dimensions of a crate containing cylindrical cans.

## File Contents
-   `new_questions.docx`: The Word document containing the complete formatted questions.

This project was completed by following the assignment's instructions, including preserving LaTeX formatting and creating new scenarios based on the base questions.
